        <p>
            A state of emergency was announced in Morocco on Saturday, April 11th, which required the complete shut down
            of schools all over the country. Therefore, a classmate and I have decided to create a platform on "Discord"
            for online learning and present it to the school's Director to continue studying on Monday without losing
            valuable class sessions. We have completed the platform within 4 hours, and I have contacted the Director
            for a
            personal meeting to express my concerns and introduce our solution. The school's administration then
            accepted the
            plan, and our platform was put in place to replace the traditional face to face classes. We were the only
            school
            in the region to face the problem with such precision and without shutting down for a week.
            <br><br>
            I have then gathered a group of friends, whom I have given a short demo on how to use the platform so that
            each
            one of them could provide a presentation to another group of students and professors, and so forth.
            <br><br>
            Finally, I was also in charge of creating and providing Class schedules for the students, keeping professors
            logs, reporting to the administration, adjusting the platform to address complaints, and giving weekly
            tutorials
            to new students and professors.
            <br><br>
            The platfom today is always operational and is being used as an alumnus server for Class of 2020.
