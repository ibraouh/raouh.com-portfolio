        <p>
            I have had the great opportunity to experience my first job in the Tech Industry in the summer of my junior
            year of High School,
            where I was closely monitored and mentored by professionals in the field. I was given the main task of Agent
            at the central Agency
            of the Moroccan Motorway Company in Rabat, Morocco, and was also in charge of all the Hardware and Software
            used by the Agents.
            This job experience came with many perks, such as constant interactions with important clients (mostly
            businesses and Public Sector High Profile Workers),
            excellent teamwork, and a great work environment. With my mentors' confirmation, I have decided to update
            the computers used by the agents to faster
            and modern machines. This boosted the morale of the agents as workflow was consistently faster. However,
            since the agency was still using an outdated
            network system, scanning the clients' cards took about 30 seconds to reach HQ's databases. I have then
            decidedto migrate the relevant database directly
            to the agency and create a duplicate at HQ, making the wait time to about .5 seconds.
            <br><br>
            Finally, my last action at the agency was to create a Google Business account for the agency, as constumers
            always complained that locating the agency was difficult:
